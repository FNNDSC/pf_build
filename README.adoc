= pf_build: **P**lugin **F**ramework **Build**er

`pf_build` is a FastAPI-based web application that greatly simplifies/accelerates the construction of ChRIS plugins. ChRIS _plugins_ are applications that run on the ChRIS platform. Importantly, ChRIS plugins are also fully independent dockerized applications that can also run directly on Linux, macOS, and Windows without needing ChRIS. This service, `pf_build`, streamlines the process of creating a basic ChRIS plugin by automating the use of the https://github.com/FNNDSC/python-chrisapp-template[ChRIS plugin template] mechanism and providing a web-based access vector.

== Need

ChRIS plugins are mostly developed by ChRIS developers, and anecdotal evidence suggests that many developers simply find the "getting started" problem too complex. Observing this, our hypothesis is that simplifying this process could help many developers by lowering this "activation energy".

`pf_build` was developed as part of the philosophy of "reducing barrier to entry" for researchers and developers to get started with ChRIS applications. It attempts to reduce the task of plugin/application construction to simply entering a few details about the author and appliction, after which `pf_build` automates all the steps to create a fully fledged, albeit mostly dummy, application.

Regardless of ChRIS per se, the artifacts created by this service are useful as python applications in their own right, with bundled `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt` and `setup.py` for "free", allowing one stop turn key creation of a fully fledged generic python project, albeit with a slight ChRIS-opiniation.

== Warning
_Ease of use_ does not mitigate _complexity_, and similarly with (some) power comes (some) responsibility. For now, it is easily possible to pollute the FNNDSC github repo with auto-generated ChRIS application repos if this service is abused. We will monitor this carefully and might need to take reactive measures if this becomes problematic.

== Workflow
`pf_build` will:

- Instantiate a new instance of the https://github.com/FNNDSC/python-chrisapp-template[ChRIS plugin template] on (by default the FNNDSC org on) github.
+
Note that by default this will be created in the FNNDSC github organization by a bot called `fnndscghbot` and as such will be owned by that bot. Developers can provide their own github PAT (personal access token) instead, in which case this template will be instantiated to the organziation associated with the provided PAT. Instructions for creating a PAT is out of scope of this document, but interested readers can consult the https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens[ relevant documentation].

- Clone the instantiated template
+
Once instantiated, `pf_build` will clone this instantiated repo.

- Edit the template `bootstrap.sh`
+
Based on the provided meta data, `pf_build` will edit the `boostrap.sh` in the cloned repo.

- Execute the template `bootstrap.sh`
+
Once edited, `pf_build` will execute the `boostrap.sh` in the cloned repo.

- Commit the changes
+
Finally, `pf_build` will commit these changes back to github, resulting in a fully instantiated ChRIS plugin/application suitable for immediate checkout and further development.

Providing a PAT in the call to `pf_build` will assure that the final repository is created and owned by the associated user. Using PATs are strongly encouraged and might become mandatory in future. However, for now and in the vein of "reducing barriers to entry", users can rely on the `fnndscghbot` to create, own, and manage application repos for them.
